A natural disaster is a major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the Earth; examples
include firestorms, duststorms, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,
tsunamis, storms, and other geologic processes. A natural disaster can cause loss of life or damage
property,[1] and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake, the severity of which depends on
the affected population's resilience and on the infrastructure available.[2]

In modern times, the divide between natural, man-made and man-accelerated is quite difficult to
draw[3][4][5] with human choices like architecture,[6] fire,[7][8] resource management[8][9] or even
climate change[10] potentially playing a role. An adverse event will not rise to the level of a
disaster if it occurs in an area without vulnerable population.[11][12] In a vulnerable area,
however, such as Nepal during the 2015 earthquake, an adverse event can have disastrous consequences
and leave lasting damage, which can take years to repair. The disastrous consequences also impact
the mental health of effected communities often leading to post-traumatic symptoms. These increased
emotional experiences can be supported through collective processing, leading to resilience and
increased community engagement.[13]
